Starting with NDK r4, you can simply place the file under $PROJECT/jni/ and launch the 'ndk-build' script from your project tree.

If you want to use 'ndk-build' but place the file to a different location, use a GNU Make variable override as:

ndk-build NDK_APPLICATION_MK=/path/to/your/Application.mk

ndk-build -C your_project_path_till_your_mkfile_folder

./gradlew cleanNative --debug
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build

find $ANDROID_NDK -name 'stdlib.h'
adb shell ifconfig | grep -i inet | cut -d" " -f12



tar xvjf filename.tar.bz2
